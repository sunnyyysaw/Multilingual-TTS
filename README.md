# Multilingual-TTS
## Overview

This project presents a multilingual Text-to-Speech (TTS) system built on Suno AI’s Bark model, a transformer-based architecture capable of producing natural, expressive speech across various languages and speaker profiles. The system is designed to overcome limitations in traditional TTS systems, such as robotic-sounding output, limited language support, and lack of voice diversity.

## Key Features

Multilingual Support: Supports a wide range of languages including English, Hindi, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Polish, and more.

Speaker Variety: Offers both male and female voice options with support for conditional speaker embeddings to customize voice tone and identity.

Realistic Output: Capable of generating not just speech, but non-verbal expressions like sighs, laughs, background sounds, and emotional tone.

Efficient Inference: Implements CPU offloading and half-precision computing for faster real-time generation.

## System Architecture

The system processes text input through a series of components to generate high-quality speech:

Text Input: User-provided text to be synthesized.

Text Preprocessing:

- Normalization: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, special character handling.

- Tokenization: Splits text into processable units.

- Text Cleaning (optional): Custom rules for typos, abbreviations, and formatting.

Text Encoder: Uses a transformer model to convert text into a meaningful numerical representation.

Mel Spectrogram Decoder: Predicts a mel spectrogram, capturing acoustic characteristics of human speech.

Vocoder: Converts the spectrogram into a final audio waveform. Users can choose from different vocoder options based on quality/speed.

Audio Post-Processing (optional):

- Volume Normalization

- Noise Reduction

Final Output: Synthesized speech can be played or saved as a WAV file.
